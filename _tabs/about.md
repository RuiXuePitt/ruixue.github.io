## Hi👋, Welcome to My Blog 🥂🎉

I am a Ph.D. candidate in High Energy Physics at the University of Pittsburgh, working in CERN's ATLAS experiment. I am a keen learner and always willing to apply advanced knowledege to practicle problems. My research interests include particle physics, statistical modeling, large scale computing and the application of AI in scientific research. I'm now based at the *European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)*, located at the border between France and Switzerland.

## 🔬 Very Brief Research Statements

My research works can be broadly divided into two areas, **software development** and **physics analysis**. On the technical side, I have contributed to the development of [**GeoModel**](https://geomodel.web.cern.ch/home/), a computer-aided design (CAD) toolkit for particle detector simulation, used by ATLAS experiment at CERN. In this project, I implemented new functionalities and improved usability for particle tracking. On the physics analysis side, I am searching for the extremely weak signals beyond the Standard Model-in other words, evidence of new physics. This involves analyzing **hundreds of terabytes of collider data** collected by the ATLAS experiment, applying advanced statistical methods and large-scale computing techniques to extract featured patterns from backgrounds. More detailed notes are available in my blogs: [**GeoModel Toolkit**](/GeoModel/), [**Top Quark Decay**](/Analysis Project/).

I developed two repositories to process the large scale data and conduct statistical analysis respectively. Notes on the two repositories are available here: [NTupleRecon](/NTuple Reconstruction/), [tenAngleAnalysis](/Ten Angle Analysis/).

Besides, I'm actively seeking for research/work opportunities in Large Language Models for science. And recently (Fall 2025), my talented collaborators and I are starting a brand new project on AI-agents for ATLAS database management. Stay tunned and more updates are on the way!
